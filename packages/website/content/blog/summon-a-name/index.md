For my many sins I foolishly thought that building a fantasy RPG name generator would be straightforward and fun. Well it wasn't. But you might as well take a look.

## What magic is this?

The algorithm behind the incantation is straightforward combining first and second names from lists based on gender and race.

Want a female elf? Randomly pick a first name from the femal elf list and a second name from the elf list and combine them.

Editing the names list will have to wait for a future version.
